## PodBot ##

Just my little Discord Bot Project.

It's my first bigger coding project (and my first C++ project, too), so don't expect to find good code.

To get this to work, you need to get the Sleepy-Discord Library, too. It's in the submodules, so it should be automatically cloned? I guess? I am new to Github.
Edit: Not it's not automatic.
